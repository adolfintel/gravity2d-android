# Gravity 2D
Create a sun, spin some asteroids around it, and watch them collide and form planets.

Gravity 2D is a Multithread N-Point Gravity Simulator.

An N-Point Gravity Simulator is a realistic simulation in which all points attract each other: even the smallest asteroid has its own gravitational field that can affect even a large sun far away from it.

This is the Android version, and uses LibGDX for the graphics.
